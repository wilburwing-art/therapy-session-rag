# Future Ideas

Ideas and feature requests captured during development. No commitment to implement - just a parking lot.

## High Priority

_Features that would significantly improve the product_

- **Predictive analytics for early intervention** - Use behavioral patterns (session frequency, engagement trends, sentiment shifts) to identify patients who may need proactive outreach before crisis
- **AI-to-human handoff protocols** - Seamless transition from chatbot to live therapist during crisis moments. Detect escalation signals, warm-transfer context to therapist, maintain conversation continuity
- **Measurement-based care dashboards** - Outcome tracking for both patients and providers. PHQ-9/GAD-7 trend lines, session-over-session progress, treatment plan adherence

## Nice to Have

_Features that would be good but aren't critical_

- **24/7 crisis support mode** - Always-available chat for urgent situations, with automatic escalation to human when risk is detected
- **Evidence-based intervention modules** - CBT, DBT, and mindfulness-based interventions built into chat (similar to Wysa, Woebot, Youper approaches)
- **Voice-based therapy calls** - Real-time crisis support with grounding techniques and breathing exercises (see: Heynoah)
- **Long-term memory** - Remember prior conversations across sessions for continuity of care
- **Between-session reflections** - Prompts to deepen insights and maintain continuity between appointments (see: Grow Therapy's "Between-Session Reflections")
- **Guided journaling** - Track emotional progress between sessions with structured prompts
- **Mental health worksheets** - Learning modules, activity plans, and homework assignments

## Technical Debt

_Refactors, optimizations, or cleanup work_

## Clinician Tools

_Features to reduce administrative burden (see: Upheal, Grow Therapy)_

- **AI-assisted progress notes** - Transform 30-minute documentation sessions into 5-minute reviews (Upheal model)
- **AI note-summarization** - Auto-summarize session transcripts for clinical notes (Grow Therapy has shipped this, significantly reducing admin work)
- **Treatment plan suggestions** - AI-generated recommendations based on session content and evidence-based protocols

## Research Needed

_Ideas that need more investigation before deciding_

- FDA regulatory pathway (Wysa received Breakthrough Device status in 2025)
- HIPAA compliance for voice-based features
- Integration patterns with existing EHR systems

## Market Context

The AI mental health market grew to ~$1.8B in 2025, projected to reach $11.8B by 2034.

**Competitors:**
- **Wysa** - Received FDA Breakthrough Device status (2025), signaling regulatory acceptance for AI therapy apps
- **Woebot, Youper** - Standalone AI therapy apps gaining traction with CBT-based approaches
- **Grow Therapy** - AI note-summarization, between-session reflections. Focus on reducing clinician admin burden
- **Upheal** - AI-assisted progress notes, transforming documentation workflows
- **Heynoah** - Voice-based therapy calls with grounding techniques and breathing exercises
- **Lyra, Modern Health, Ginger** - B2B workplace wellness (BetterHelp building competing B2B offering)

**Trend:** Platforms focus on augmenting therapists rather than replacing them. Admin burden reduction is the wedge, with patient-facing AI features as the expansion play.
