# Future Ideas

Ideas and feature requests captured during development. No commitment to implement - just a parking lot.

## High Priority

_Features that would significantly improve the product_

- **Predictive analytics for early intervention** - Use behavioral patterns to identify patients who may need proactive outreach
- **AI-to-human handoff protocols** - Seamless transition from chatbot to live therapist during crisis moments
- **Measurement-based care dashboards** - Outcome tracking for both patients and providers

## Nice to Have

_Features that would be good but aren't critical_

- **24/7 crisis support mode** - Enhanced availability features for urgent situations
- **Evidence-based intervention modules** - CBT, DBT, and mindfulness-based interventions built into chat
- **Voice-based therapy calls** - Real-time crisis support with grounding techniques and breathing exercises
- **Long-term memory** - Remember prior conversations across sessions for continuity
- **Between-session reflections** - Prompts to deepen insights between appointments
- **Guided journaling** - Track emotional progress between sessions
- **Mental health worksheets** - Learning modules and activity plans

## Technical Debt

_Refactors, optimizations, or cleanup work_

## Clinician Tools

_Features to reduce administrative burden_

- **AI-assisted progress notes** - Transform 30-minute documentation into 5-minute reviews
- **AI note-summarization** - Auto-summarize session transcripts for clinical notes
- **Treatment plan suggestions** - AI-generated recommendations based on session content

## Research Needed

_Ideas that need more investigation before deciding_

- FDA regulatory pathway (Wysa received Breakthrough Device status in 2025)
- HIPAA compliance for voice-based features
- Integration patterns with existing EHR systems

## Market Context

The AI mental health market grew to ~$1.8B in 2025, projected to reach $11.8B by 2034. Competitors like Wysa, Woebot, and Youper are gaining traction. Grow Therapy and others are focusing on reducing clinician administrative burden rather than replacing therapists.
